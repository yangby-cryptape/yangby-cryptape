### Hirable for Part-Time

For me, the following part-time jobs are acceptable:
- Back nude stand-in for actresses who have long hairs. \
  Why only for back? Because my beard is very long, too.
- Play ordinary men in ancient China, except in [Qing Dynasty]. \
  Because in [Qing Dynasty], men are forced to keep *ugly* rat tail hairstyle (a.k.a. [Manchu Queue]).

_p.s. This section just for fun._ :smirk: \
_p.s.s. Even though it's a joke, I would still accept it if the income :moneybag: was substantial._ :money_mouth_face:
